### In this file collection you can find supplementary material relative at Chapter 1 of Francesco Mugnaiâ€™s PhD thesis.
1. **Supplementary_material_S1.pdf** is an overview of DNA barcoding initiatives.
2. **Supplementary_material_S2.pdf** contains a list of morphological and molecular data retrieved in May 2021 and compared with Bucklin et al., 2011.
3. **Supplementary_material_S3.pdf** shows details regarding number of nominal marine animal species and relative COI-sequenced taxa per phylum in the five target Large Marine Ecosystems
4. **Supplementary_material_S4.pdf** reports A) Total number of nominal marine Chordata species and relative COI-sequenced taxa per phylum and B) relative values scattered for each of the five target Large Marine Ecosystems
5. **Supplementary_material_S5.pdf** contains details about A) Number of COI sequences and relative presence in NCBI and BOLD databases scattered along all the chosen LMEs. B) Number of barcodes per species shared at least by two LMEs.
